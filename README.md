# Ray's Neovim Config

This is my personal Neovim configuration. 
Nothing special is going on.

## Structure

At the root level, we have the following directories:

- lua
- snippets
- ftplugin
- after


As you may know, the `lua` directory has the most useful configuration files, like plugins.


---

Inside the `lua` directory, we have the following directories:

- custom
- larp
- overseer

The `larp` directory is where I keep most of the configurations, like options, keymaps, and plugins.

The `custom` directory is where I keep the configurations for the plugins that I have customized.

The `overseer` directory has various build rules used by the _overseer_ plugin. (Though, I barely use it.)
